/**
 * 274. H-Index
 *      Given an array of citations(each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
 *      researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index
 *      A scientist has index h if h of his/her N paper have at least h citations
 *      each, and the other N-h paper have no more than h citation each
 *
 *      Example:
 *          given citations = [3,0,6,1,5] which means the researcher has 5 papers
 *          in total and each of them had recived 3,0,6,1,5 citations
 *          Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
 *          and remaining two with no more than 3 citation each, h-index is 3
