/**
 *	449.Serialize and Deserialize BST:
 *	Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that is can be 
 * 	stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the 
 *	same or another computer environment.
 *	Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your 
 *	serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be 
 *	serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 *	//The encoded string should be as compact as possible
